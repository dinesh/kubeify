    <p>We believe that developers should be able focus more on building features and less on how and where
      their applications run.</p>

    <p>We believe that ops engineers should be able to easily manage thousands of instances
        of complex applications with simple tools.</p>

    <p>We believe the days of single-region deployments are coming to an end for many applications. Datasets are
          growing and becoming geographically distributed. Data needs to be close to users and
          applications need to be pushed to where the data is stored.</p>

    <p>We believe that the complexity of software maintenance is the major obstacle
            to faster adoption of new technologies and growth for technology creators.</p>
